# DIY Eco Station

In this project you will learn how to build a senseBox environmental station. At the end you will be able to measure various environmental phenomena such as temperature, humidity, light and air pressure, and you can publish the data on openSenseMap!

This project is the most extensive, therefore it was divided into several chapters. In each new chapter, an additional module is inserted until a full - senseBox: home like - Environmental Station is built!
