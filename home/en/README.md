# senseBox:home

The senseBox:home is a citizen science DIY-toolkit for lowcost measurement of environmental data like temperature, air humidity, air pressure and (UV-) light intensity.
It is based on the arduino/genuino platform and is easily integrated into our sensorweb-platform [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org).

On these pages you will find the documentation and building instructions for the senseBox:home.
