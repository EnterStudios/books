# Contributing Projects

If you developed a senseBox project on your own and did document it, you may add it to this book!

Such a documentation should provide an overview over the project as well as a step-by-step tutorial on how to build / reproduce the project.
Photos and code may be included, too!

For this book's management we use [github.com](https://github.com) and the tool [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/), all content is written in [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/).

Besides new project tutorials we also appreciate any improvements or corrections to the existing content!

## Writing the documentation
The documentation should be written in markdown, so the content can be directly included in the book.
If you are not familiar with markdown, have a look at an explanation and syntax-explanation [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

To streamline the writing of markdown we recommend dedicated editors, such as the web-editor [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/editor).

### Content
Should it be applicable to your project, you may use our <a href="./community_projects/project_template.md" target="_blank">**project template**</a> as a starting point.

Make shure you provide all information required to reproduce your project with a senseBox:edu kit!

### File structure
Place your documentation file in the directory `en/community_projects/`.

If you want to include additional resources, place them in a subfolder with the same name:

```
mobile-weatherstation.md
mobile-weatherstation/overview.jpg
mobile-weatherstation/mobile-weatherstation.ino
```

Filenames may not include any spaces!

## Content license
Your contribution will be added under the same [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license as our content.
This means, that the content may be freely adopted by others, as long as the authors name is provided with the content.

## Uploading the documentation
To provide us your documentation, you can insert it in the book yourself by submitting a pull request on GitHub.
The source code of this book is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sensebox/books).
**Fork this repository, add your content there, and create a new pull request.**

In case you are unfamiliar with the GitHub process, have a look at a [GitHub contribution guide](https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/).

Alternatively to working directly on GitHub, there is also a [Gitbook.com editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor), wich might simplify the process. However we didn't try that one.

If none of that works, just send us your contribution written in markdown [via mail](mailto:info@sensebox.de?subject=Project tutorial senseBox:edu).

**Thank you for your contribution!**
