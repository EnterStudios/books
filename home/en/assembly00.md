# Building instructions for your senseBox:home

Once assembled, programmed and synchronized with the [openSenseMap](https://opensensemap.org), a senseBox:home reports location-aware measurements of the phenomena temperature, relative air humidity, air pressure and (UV-) light intensity.

This manual is divided into the following sections:

1. [Inventory](assembly01_inventory.md)
2. [Software installation and sensor testing](assembly02_software.md)
3. [Registration on the openSenseMap](assembly03_osem.md)
4. [Exemplary application](assembly04_example.md)

If you have questions about the assembly, which are not answered in this manual, please contact us under [support@sensebox.de](mailto:support@sensebox.de).

The senseBox team wishes you fun and success with your new Do-It-Yourself sensor station!
