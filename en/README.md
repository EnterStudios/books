# senseBox:edu
The senseBox:edu is a toolbox which helps teach programming to students and junior researchers in a playful manner.

The Arduino-based set of electronic components is used to build increasingly complex circuits, which are controlled via a microcontroller.

Along with the learning resources provided on these pages, young students can gather experience in (Arduino) programming and electronic circuits with hands-on training.
