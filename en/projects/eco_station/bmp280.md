# DIY - Air Pressure Sensor

## Required Reading
- [serial data bus I²C](../../basics/i2c.md)

## Aim of this lesson
This lesson shows how to read measurements from the BMP280 air pressure sensor.

## Material

- `BMP280` air pressure & -temperature sensor

## Basics

<!--sec data-title="BMP280 Sensor" data-id="grundlagensensor" data-collapse=true ces-->
The BMP280 is capable of measuring air pressure in hectopascal (hPa) as well as air temperature (°C).
This sensor communicates via the [I²C protocol](../../basics/i2c.md), and requires an operating voltage of 3.3 - 5.0 volts.

The I²C address of the BMP280 can be changed through it's `SDO` pin:
If `SDO` is connected to `GND`, the address will be `0x76`, otherwise `0x77`.

<!--sec data-title="Inferring height from air pressure" data-id="grundlagenhoehe" data-collapse=true ces-->
Air pressure varies with the height above sea level:
The higher you are, the lower the air pressure will get.
This means, that we can deduce our height above sea level from a pressure measurement!

To do so, we need a reference value of the current pressure at sea level, usually called `P0`.
Because this value constantly changes through the weather, and depends roughly on the current location,
  we have to recalibrate this value regularly for accurate measurements.

## Construction
The operating voltage is provided to the sensor through the wires `3.3V -> VCC` and `GND -> GND`.
The I²C bus is set up as usual via the `SDA` and `SCL` pins.

Additionally this sensor requires a wire from `GND` to `SDO` on the BMP280.
This changes the sensors address from `0x77` to `0x76`, which is the configured value in the `BMP280.h` library.

## Program
The sensor can be controlled with the `BMP280.h` library.
Once this file is included in the sketch, we can create an instance `bmp` of it.
Now we are able to call the libraries functions on this object:

```arduino
#include <BMP280.h>
#include <Wire.h>
BMP280 bmp;
```

In the `setup()` function we initialize the sensor with the following lines:

```arduino
if (!bmp.begin()) {
  Serial.println("BMP init failed!");
}
bmp.setOversampling(4); // select resolution of the measurements
```

Now we need to can issue a measurement in the `loop()` function.
The variables `temp` and `pressure` will then contain the current measurement values:

```arduino
double temp, pressure;
char bmpStatus = bmp.startMeasurment();

// if an error occured on the sensor: stop
if (bmpStatus == 0) {
  Serial.println(bmp.getError());
  return;
}

delay(bmpStatus); // wait for duration of the measurement
bmpStatus = bmp.getTemperatureAndPressure(temp, pressure);
```

## Exercises
<!--sec data-title="Exercise 1" data-id="aufg1" data-collapse=true ces-->
Connect the `BMP280` sensor with the arduino, and create a sketch that prints the current air pressure and temperature on the *serial monitor*.
<!-- endsec -->

<!--sec data-title="Exercise 2" data-id="aufg2" data-collapse=true ces-->
Consider the code above which reads from the `BMP280`.
What is the variable `bmpStatus` used for?
<!-- endsec -->

<!--sec data-title="Exercise 3" data-id="aufg3" data-collapse=true ces-->
You learned that you can derive the height of your senseBox from the current air pressure.
Use the function `bmp.altitude(...)` to calculate the height, and print it on the *serial monitor* as well.

> ***Hint:*** *Have a look at the example file in the BMP280 library. For correct values, the reference value `P0` needs to be adapted to the current weather: You can find your local value [here](https://www.meteoblue.com/en/weather/webmap/index/?variable=mslp_pressure&level=surface&lines=none).
