1. **Arduino & Breadboard:**
All of the senseBox experiments are based on the main board. It consists of an Arduino Uno microcontroller, a senseBox shield, as well as a breadboard.
The **breadboard** enables plug & play interconnection of electronic components on its many conductive lines.
It has two pairs of vertical lines (marked with `+` and `-`), and 30 horizontal lines with 5 connectors each (marked `a` to `e`, resp. `f` to `j`).

    The **senseBox shield** is an Arduino extension board, that is plugged in on top of the Arduino connectors. It provides a microSD-card slot for data storage, a real-time clock, as well as additional I²C connectors. The RTC will be enabled as soon as the battery is inserted into the shield.

2. **Power supply:**
During programming and experiments, you can provide power to the microcontroller via the included USB cable.
Once you have completed your project, you may run the Arduino without a computer attached by using the included power supply.

3. **Batterypack:**
A batterypack allows you to use your senseBox on the go!
This is especially useful if you want to do measurements at multiple different places.

4. **Ethernet- or WiFi-Shield:**
The senseBox includes another shield for network connectivity.
Depending on the senseBox version, this is a red ethernet shield or a blue WiFi-shield.
By attaching this to the arduino, you can upload your data to the openSenseMap for example.

5. **Wires:**
Besides the USB-B cable, there are many jumper wires with mixed male and female connectors included.
These allow you to build your circuits on the breadboard in no time!
Also there is a cable for the batterypack included.

6. **Sensors and electronic components:**
    The following list shows all the sensors and other electronic parts that are needed for the experiments:

    * Air temperature and humidity sensor (HDC1008)
    * Air pressure and temperature sensor (BMP280)
