# DIY Eco Station

In this project we will learn how to build a senseBox environmental station. At the end we will be able to measure various environmental phenomena such as temperature, humidity, light and air pressure, and the data will be published on the openSenseMap!

This project is the most extensive, therefore it was divided into several chapters. In each new chapter, an additional module is inserted until a full - senseBox:home like - Environmental Station is built!

You may work through each chapter separately, or extend your program code with each chapter to be able to measure all five phenomena at once.
