# senseBox:edu
The senseBox:edu is a toolbox which helps teaching programming to students and junior-researchers in a playful manner.

The Arduino-based set of electronic components is used to build increasingly complex circuits, which are controlled via a microcontroller.

With the learning-resources on these pages, the young students can gather experience in (Arduino-) programming and electronic circuits with hands-on training.
