# openSenseMap registration

Here the integration of your senseBox:home in our sensor network *openSenseMap* is described.
On this platform a registration is required, where you specify the exact setup of your box.

> ***hint:*** *you may change the OSeM website-language in the navbar!*

## Registrierung auf der openSenseMap

Register your senseBox by filling out the form [here](http://www.opensensemap.org/register).
In step 2 of the registration you are asked for a hardware setup specification. Choose *senseBox:home* and tick the *senseBox:home with ethernet* checkbox.

Once completed, you will recieve an email, containing keys for your senseBox and sensors, as well as an custom arduino sketch (see the file extension `.ino`) which you'll need to upload onto the microcontroller.

> For users from the *Make Light* initiative: Please fill in `MakeLight` in the field *Group identifier*!

## Upload the sketch

Once you downloaded the `sensebox.ino` attachment from the email, you need to upload the sketch onto the microcontroller, as was already described in section 2.
Here's a brief summary of the steps:

1. open the Arduino IDE
2. in the toolbar select `File` â†’ `Open` and choose the downloaded `sensebox.ino` sketch
3. confirm the dialog with "yes"
4. upload the sketch onto the microcontroller using the **arrow** button

If nothing went wrong, you can now view your station on the openSenseMap (use the link in the email) and view the uploaded measurements!
