#DIY - Experiments with light
If we watch television, turn on the radio, write a message with our smartphone, or heat up food in the microwave, we are using electromagnetic energy. Today, all people are constantly dependent on this energy. Without it, life as we know it in modern cities would be completely different.

## Aim of the station
In this station we are using a light sensor to detect the illuminance of visible light in lux.

##Materials
* Light Sensor `TSL 45315`

## Basics
Electromagnetic energy moves in waves through space. These waves range from very long radio waves to very short wavelength gamma rays. The human eye can only perceive a very small part of this spectrum: visible light. Our sun is the source of energy over the entire spectrum. The Earth's atmosphere protects us from exposure to high levels of radiation that could be dangerous for us.

Here, the intensity of visible light is of main interest. To measure the illuminance of the incident light in the visible part of the spectrum, the unit lux is used. It indicates the ratio of the brightness in lumens per square meter. On a bright sunny day, the light is measured at about 100,000 lux, and for a full moon at night the illuminance is measured at only about 1 lux.

For this measurement you use the I2C sensor TSL45315 of AMS-TAOS. In the sensor datasheet you can see that its sensitivity is matched to the visible part of the light spectrum, which is approximately between 400 and 700 nm.

According to the data sheet, the sensitivity of this sensor reaches from 2 to 200000 Lux, with a resolution of 3 lux. Furthermore, the sensor needs a power supply of 3.3V.

##Construction

## Basics
We will use the library `Wire`. In the beginning we need a few constants that are defined  with the directive #. Unlike variables, they occupy a permanent place in the store. In our case, the bus address and the following register addresses of the sensor are to be saved.

<Img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sensebox/resources/master/images/edu//Grundlagen_Station_6.png" />

These registers are used to configure and for communication:
`` `Arduino
#include <Wire.h>
#define I2C_ADDR (0x29)
#define REG_CONTROL 0x00
#define REG_CONFIG 0x01
#define REG_DATALOW 0x04
#define REG_DATAHIGH 0x05
#define REG_ID 0x0A
`` `

In the setup function you will connect the sensor and start the transmission.

`` `Arduino
Wire.begin ();
Wire.beginTransmission (I2C_ADDR);
Wire.write (0x80 | REG_CONTROL);
Wire.write (0x03); // Power on
Wire.endTransmission ();
`` `

Next, we will set a fixed exposure time of 400 ms:

`` `Arduino
Wire.beginTransmisson (I2C_ADDR);
Wire.write (0x80 | REG_CONFIG);
Wire.write (0x00); // 400 ms
Wire.endTransmission ();
`` `

To change the shutter speed, you can change the corresponding value of `` 0x00` in 0x01` or `0x02` to reduce the exposure time to 200 or 100 ms in the configuration register of the sensor.
In the Loop function, we give the order to start the measurement routine and let the sensor send the data needed to calculate the illuminance:

`` `Arduino
Wire.beginTransmisson (I2C_ADDR);
Wire.write (0x80 | REG_DATALOW);
Wire.endTransmission ();
Wire.requestFrom (I2C_ADDR, 2); Request // 2 bytes
uint16_t low = Wire.read ();
uint16_t high = Wire.read ();
`` `

If the sensor still sends data, these should be caught afterwards, to avoid errors in the next passage.

`` `Arduino
while (Wire.available ()) {
Wire.read ();
}
`` `

Finally, you will use the data to calculate illuminance in lux. In the data sheet, there is the matching formula:

`` `Arduino
uint32_t lux;
lux = (high << 8) | (Low << 0);
lux lux = * 1; // Multiplier for 400ms
`` `

To adjust this formula to an exposure time of 200 or 100 ms, you can increase the multiplier to 2 or 4.

##Exercise 1
Adapt this lesson's code to create a custom function that can print the sensor data to the Serial Monitor.

##Exercise 2
Change the exposure time of the sensor and then compare the results of the measurements.

Tip: Donâ€™t forget to adjust both the lux value and exposure time in the configuration register accordingly.
