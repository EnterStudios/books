# Arduino IDE

The Arduino IDE is the programming interface we use for our microcontroller. The white editor window represents the area for your programming code. In the black area, status and error messages will be displayed. The Arduino IDE is able to recognize misspellings and errors in your code's syntax, however logic errors can not be recognized.

In the upper toolbar of the software, you can find the most important elements to control the software:

- The checkmark is used to check your programâ€™s code if there are any mistakes.
- The arrow is used to upload your sketch to the Arduino.
- You can start a new sketch, open an existing one, or save your current sketch
- By using the magnifying glass, you can open the serial monitor. For further information about the serial monitor, check [here](../basics/serial_monitor.md)
